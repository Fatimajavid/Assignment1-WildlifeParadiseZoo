            <h6 style="color:white"> These spotted leopards live in the mountains across a vast range of Asia, covered with snow. Snow leopards live above the tree line at altitudes of 3000 to 6000 m. In the winter, snow leopards will live at lower altitudes, coming into forests and valleys. They are insulated by thick hair in shades of gray or creamy yellow and covered with grayish black spots. Their wide, fur-covered feet act as natural snowshoes. These big cats use their long tails for balance and as blankets to cover sensitive body parts against the severe mountain chill. They are shy and reclusive, and rarely seen in the wild because their unique coloring helps the cat blend into its stony, mountain habitat. They have long, powerful hind legs, so they are excellent jumpers. They can leap as far as 50 feet. Though normally solitary animals, snow leopards do get together in late winter to breed. After 90-100 days, the female snow leopard lines her den with fur and gives birth to a litter of cubs. A typical litter consists of around 2-3 cubs, but there could be as many as 5. She will raise the cubs by herself for 18 months until they are ready to venture out on their own. <br>Snow leopards play a key role as a top predator, an indicator of the health of their high-altitude habitat. Snow leopards prey on Himalayan blue sheep, Siberian ibex, tahr, markhor, wild goat, deer species, and even wild boars. Smaller mammals are also a part of their diets, such as hares and flying squirrels. By regulating grazing and burrowing species living in the high altitudes of mountains, snow leopards help keep river banks from eroding and maintain the freshwater reservoirs. They eat significant amounts of vegetation as well, including grass and twigs. However, snow leopards are still considered vulnerable of extinction. Their population is currently in decline. Major threats include poaching for the fur trade and traditional medicines, as well as the loss of prey and habitat due to livestock farming, mining, and development.</h6>
