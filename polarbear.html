        <h3> Introducing the Largest Land Carnivores!<br><b>THE POLAR BEARS!</b></h3>
    </div>
    
    <div class="column4">
        <h4> Polar bears have thick fur that appears to be white covering black skin. The fur and a thick layer of fat keep them warm. The black skin helps to absorb heat from the Sun. Polar bears even have fur on the soles of their feet. This fur protects the feet and keeps them from slipping. Sharp claws also help polar bears to walk on ice and to kill prey. Polar bears prey on sea mammals, especially seals. They are good hunters, but they also will eat dead fish and stranded whales. Polar bears hunt both on the ice and in the water. Polar bears are hood swimmers and can sustain a pace of six miles per hour by paddling with their front paws and holding their hind legs flat like a rudder. Their water-repellent coat of fur insulates them from the cold air and water. In the winter, female polar bears give birth in their dens. They can have from one to four tiny cubs at a time. The mother nurses them for about two years. During the spring the mother leaves her den and teaches her cubs how to hunt. After they are weaned, cubs stay with their mother until they are ready to mate. <br>Polars bears are the largest ears in the world and a major predator in the Arctic. Though they have no predators, they are still a threatened species. One reason is that the amount of sea ice in the Arctic has been shrinking due to global warming. Melting sea ice means that polar bears have less space to hunt and to mate.</h4>
